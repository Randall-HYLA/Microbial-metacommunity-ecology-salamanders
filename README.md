# Microbial-metacommunity-ecology-salamanders

This repository contains the code used for the analyses in the article titled “Microbial metacommunity ecology: using null models and networks to understand assembly in a salamander disease system”. The study explores the ecological processes shaping the skin microbiomes of three Appalachian salamander species and their associated environments using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and a range of novel analytical approaches grounded in community and metacommunity ecology.

We tested hypotheses related to:

    Deterministic processes such as environmental selection and evolutionary history

    Patch dynamics, including competition–colonization trade-offs within microbiome networks

    The influence of fungal exposure on the abundance of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd)-inhibitory bacteria

Analyses include comparisons across species and habitats (forest, stream, pond), microbial community assembly modeling (deterministic vs. stochastic), and bipartite network analyses
